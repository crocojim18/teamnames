# teamnames
Randomly Generated Sports Team Names

## `python generator.py` will make 10 random sports team names
This all includes:
* nouns.txt - English plural nouns scraped from Wiktionary
* places.txt - United States place names scraped from Wiktionary
* the spider I used to scrape those (change the url in noun.py and run `scrapy crawl noun`)
** _Scrapy is required to run the spider_

## Have at 'em, folks
